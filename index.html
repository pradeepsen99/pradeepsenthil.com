							<h2 class="major">CVents</h2>

							<p>A Social Eventing app that lets users see events close to them. Users of the app can also make public or private events to 
								meet new friends or make plans in an all in one application. Created during MHacks 2018.
							</p>
							<p>We were inspired to make a project that would help streamline the arduous process of organizing events with your friends. 
								Another thing we were trying to accomplish is to get people's sense of community stronger by giving people the option to 
								join public events.
							</p>
							<p>The way the app works is a person signs into the app with their phone number and once they're in, they can create an event (public/private) 
								and choose the location for it to be held. Once that's done, they can invite people to the event. Also if the event
								 is set to public anyone can join the event.
							</p>
							<p>The app is build using Swift using Xcode. The backend consists of Firebase and Twilio. Firebase stores the events, 
								lat-long of the people and also stores all of the user-info.</p>

								This is a 2D side scroller. The player is given the ability to jump in order to jump and dodge the obstacles in front of them. Some of the
								obstacles that the player might be rpesented with are the buildings themselves and also random objects that may appear.
							</p>
							<p>
								The main goal of the game is for the player to go through the level collecting all of the money presented in front of them. The money picked up 
								is calculated into the score value which is the metric the player will use to see how well they do.
							</p>
							<p>
								The game was made entirely in C# and Unity3D. Unity was used to get the interface together and also get the animations into the game. The main
								codebase was written in C# and this consisted of the code behind the player movement, object collision, score counting, etc.

							<p></p>
							<p>I'm a college student in my junior year studying at University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign <br/><br/>
							   One of the main reasons why I like to code and develop is the creative freedom you get throughout the process.
							   When I'm working on projects that's where I'm putting my creative muscles to work, coming up with creative solutions
							   to otherwise complicated problems and also breaking complex problems down into a more simpler level and working on them
							   is also one of the biggest reasons I like developing.<br/><br/>
							   <img style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain' src="images/skills_usa.jpg" alt="" /></span><br/>
							   One of my favorite things to work on are group projects that are completed in a relatively short amount of time.
							   This has led me to participating in multiple completitions like Hackathons and events like SkillsUSA. The above picture is
							   me and my team winning second place for a programming competition called SkillsUSA where we coded a 2d side scroller and presented
							   it to judges.

							<p>In 2016, I went to Rwanda to do an internship with a company called HeHe Labs. In there I was able to work with one of their
							   fellowship programs and help with integrating Github into their project.<br/>
							   The project I worked on was called InventEd, the project's goal was to closen the gap between skilled workers and the general public.
							   Through the use of the webstie people will be able to create projects and put them in a virtual marketplace where skilled workers who
							   were able to perform the task could join in and then they'd get paid for the job that they did. <br/>
							   The project was built in JS and PHP which most of the frontend and backend work being done by the members of the fellowship program. I
							   worked on the Github integration part because there was plans to make additions into the project to have it also include programming
							   as one of the potential projects people could request.<br/><br/>
